# Symbols In English

The other day, I was explaining my code to a native English speaker, and I was really freaking out because I couldn't remember the symbols in English.

So, I decided to write this short post just to keep these symbols for a quick review when I need them. Obviously, there are some "easy to remember" symbols, but I hope it could help someone :)
