# Symbols In English

The other day, I was explaining my code to a native English speaker, and I was really freaking out because I couldn't remember the symbols in English.

So, I decided to write this short post just to keep these symbols for a quick review when I need them. Obviously, there are some "easy to remember" symbols, but I hope it could help someone :)

| \+          |  Plus                 |
| \-          | Minus                 | 
| \.          | Dot / Point           |    
| %           | Percent               |

| \{\}        | Braces                |
| ,           | Comma                 |
| :           | Colon                 |
| ;           | Semi-colon            |
| \-          | Hypen / Dash          |
| @           | At sign               |
| ""          | Quotation marks       |
| \_          | Underscore            |
| &           | And sign              |
| \*          | Asterisk              |
| \|          | Pipe                  |
| \!          | Exclamation mark      |

That's all :)
